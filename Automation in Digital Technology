Basic Idea of Automation in Digital Technology
Automation in digital technology refers to using software, scripts, or systems to perform tasks without manual intervention. It improves efficiency, reduces errors, and saves time.
Key Aspects of Automation:
Task Automation:
- Replacing repetitive manual tasks with scripts or programs.
- Example: Using a script to open Google Chrome automatically every day at a fixed time.
Process Automation:
- Automating workflows in businesses and organizations.
- Example: Automated email responses, data entry in spreadsheets.
IT & System Automation:
- Managing servers, networks, and applications with minimal human effort.
- Example: Automating software updates on multiple computers.
AI and Machine Learning in Automation:
- Using artificial intelligence to make decisions and optimize processes.
- Example: Chatbots responding to customer queries.
Home & Industrial Automation:
- Smart devices controlling home appliances.
- Example: Automating lights and security systems.
Common Automation Tools & Technologies:
Shell Scripting (Bash, PowerShell) – Automating OS-level tasks.
Python & JavaScript – Writing scripts for automation.
Cron Jobs (Linux) & Task Scheduler (Windows) – Scheduling automated tasks.
RPA (Robotic Process Automation) – Automating business workflows.
Impact of Automation:
- Saves time & effort
- Reduces human error
- Enhances productivity
- Enables innovation in digital technology

Examples of Automation Using Machines and Drones
